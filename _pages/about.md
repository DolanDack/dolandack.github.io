So, a few words about me.

I come from Athens, Greece and I have been living in London since 2012. But also, I spent a good part of my life in Rhodes, Greece.

My undergraduate studies where in Greece, Athens and I studied industrial engineering. After a long break to work in the industry (including a variety of roles in medium sized companies, data engineer, data forecasting and analysis) I enroled in 2016 the Computational Statistics and Machine Learning programme in University College London (UCL). There, I focused mainly in approximate methods, Bayesian statistics, and Gaussian processes. 

Afterwards, I joined Barclays Investment Bank as a statistical modeller. In 2019, I joined JPMorgan as a Senior Machine Learning scientist. Finally, in 2023 I enrolled in the joined Bioengineering-Mathematics PhD programme in Imperial College London, AI for Healthcare, where I am being supervised by Molly Stevels and Mauricio Barahona. My project is focused on analysing Raman spectroscopy signals and applying deep learning models in bioengineering.

Apart from my studies and work in statistics/machine learning, I do enjoy spending my time listening to music (from Jazz, to Rock, and Metal), and reading/learning about socialist political history and anarchism. So, you will see quite a few topics of this nature in here. In the words of the great Nina Simone

> We never talked about men or clothes. It was always *Marx* *, Lenin and revolution – real girls' talk. – Nina Simone*

My plan to make this webpage as a personal notebook where I will keep track of ideas, learning, and everything in between my PhD journey and hopefully help someone who might have to go through the same materials.
